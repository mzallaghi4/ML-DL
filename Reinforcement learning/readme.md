## Reinforcement learning (RL)

RL is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize a reward signal. 

It's a trial-and-error process where the agent learns from the feedback of its actions, refining its decision-making strategy over time to achieve optimal results!

### RL algorithms classification 
- State space:  discrete & continuous 
- Action space:  discrete & continuous 
- off-policy & on-policy 

#### Implementation 
- Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
- Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
